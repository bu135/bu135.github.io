excerpt: 'This article proposes a method for inventorying a stereo warehouse using a single camera, including a detection network combined with the Swim Transformer Block and a counting algorithm that integrates stack prior knowledge. We also collected the WSGID stereo warehouse crate dataset and achieved an 85.71% inventory counting accuracy on this dataset.'

This article proposes a method for inventorying a stereo warehouse using a single camera, including a detection network combined with the Swim Transformer Block and a counting algorithm that integrates stack prior knowledge. We also collected the WSGID stereo warehouse crate dataset and achieved an 85.71% inventory counting accuracy on this dataset.
