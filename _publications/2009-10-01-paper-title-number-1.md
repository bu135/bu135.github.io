This paper addresses a notorious problem in unsupervised multi-class anomaly detection : *"identiy short cut issue"*. We explore the generative-based approach and investigate latent diffusion models for anomalies reconstruction, and then introduce a feature editing strategy to further alleviate it, leading to fewer false positive predictions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets MVTec-AD and MPDD show that the proposed method performs state-of-art methods by a significant margin.
